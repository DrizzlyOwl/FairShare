**FairShare** is a modern, high-performance web utility designed to help couples determine a fair and proportionate way to split household expenses. By moving beyond the standard 50/50 split—which can be inequitable when salaries differ significantly—this tool calculates contributions based on each partner's relative earning power.

## 🌟 Project Overview

FairShare automates household budgeting by establishing a contribution ratio based on relative income. It ensures both partners retain a fair share of disposable income, removing financial friction. 

### ✨ Key Features
- **🧠 Smart Ratio Calculation**: Automatically estimates net monthly take-home pay (after tax and NI) to ensure contribution ratios are truly fair.
- **🌗 Dark Mode & Themes**: Fully themed UI with native support for system preferences and manual overrides.
- **📊 Detailed Roadmap**: Generates a final report separating **Initial Upfront Costs** from **Ongoing Monthly Shares**.
- **🌐 Real-World Data**: Fetches estimated property values via the UK Land Registry SPARQL endpoint.
- **⚡ PWA Ready**: Fully installable on iOS and Android with offline functionality.
- **♿ Accessibility First**: Strictly **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliant with legible typography and keyboard navigation.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

FairShare is built using a **Decoupled Modular Design** powered by ES6 modules. This architecture ensures high maintainability and testability without the overhead of a framework.

### 1. Core Concepts & Design Patterns
- **Reactive State (Proxy Pattern)**: State in `State.js` is wrapped in a Javascript Proxy, triggering UI renders and `localStorage` sync automatically.
- **Pure Functional Logic**: All financial logic in `FinanceEngine.js` consists of side-effect-free pure functions.
- **Specialized Controllers**:
    - **`NavigationController`**: Manages hash-based routing and keyboard navigation.
    - **`FormController`**: Handles input life-cycles and real-time validation.
    - **`UIManager`**: Orchestrates BEM-compliant DOM updates.
